This Smart Irrigation System uses a Machine Learning-based approach to make intelligent decisions about when to activate or deactivate the water pump in a garden. By analyzing soil moisture levels and ambient temperature, the system predicts whether the plants need watering using a Random Forest Classifier.

Unlike traditional systems, this model does not rely on fixed thresholds. Instead, it learns patterns from past data to make more accurate and adaptive decisions. According to the analysis, the trained model achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, ensuring reliable and optimized irrigation.

Over-irrigation is a common problem in gardening and agriculture, leading to nutrient loss, root damage, and water wastage. By avoiding unnecessary watering, this smart solution promotes sustainable gardening practices and helps conserve water â€” a critical resource.

This project offers an ideal blend of technology and sustainability, making it a perfect innovation for environmentally conscious gardening enthusiasts.
